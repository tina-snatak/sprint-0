## 1. Introduction

This documentation describes the design and approach for creating an Ansible role to automate Jenkins installation and configuration.  
Jenkins is a widely-used automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating software projects.  
While the role implementation will be done in the next sprint, this document outlines the purpose, benefits, and the standard Jenkins setup as a Proof of Concept (POC).

---

## 2. What is Jenkins Ansible Role?
A Jenkins Ansible Role is a reusable set of Ansible tasks, handlers, variables, and templates aimed at automating Jenkins setup and configuration.  
Roles provide modularity and standardization for infrastructure-as-code automation, making deployments consistent and easy to manage.

An **Ansible Role** is a reusable, modular way to organize automation tasks, variables, handlers, and files in a structured directory format. It helps keep playbooks clean by logically grouping related configurations.

Roles can be shared via **Ansible Galaxy** or stored locally for internal projects.Official documentation: [Ansible Roles Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)

## 3. Why Use Jenkins Ansible Role?

- Automate Jenkins installation and reduce manual steps.  
- Ensure consistent Jenkins environment across multiple servers.  
- Simplify management and updates of Jenkins configurations.  
- Enable repeatable deployments in development, testing, and production environments.  
- Integrate with existing CI/CD workflows managed by Ansible.

| 1         | What is an Ansible Role?                                                      | An Ansible Role is a structured way to organize tasks, handlers, variables, templates, and files, making automation modular and reusable.         |
| 2         | Why should I use an Ansible Role for Jenkins instead of a plain playbook?     | Roles provide modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance compared to large monolithic playbooks.                                           |
| 3         | Can this role work on multiple operating systems?                             | Yes. It can be parameterized to support multiple Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL).                                              |
| 4         | How do I override default variables in a role?                                | Override them in your playbook or inventory files using higher precedence variables.                                                            |
| 5         | How can I securely store Jenkins admin credentials in Ansible?                | Use **Ansible Vault** to encrypt sensitive data like passwords, API tokens, and private keys.                                                   |
| 6         | What if a plugin or Jenkins version changes?                                  | Update the variables in `defaults/main.yml` or provide them via playbook so that the role remains flexible.                                      |
| 7         | How do I test this role before using it in production?                        | Use the `tests/` directory with a sample inventory and playbook, or test in a staging environment before production deployment.                  |
| 8         | Is the role idempotent?                                                       | Yes. Tasks are written to ensure repeated runs do not cause unintended changes (idempotency principle).                                         |
