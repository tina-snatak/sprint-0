## 1. What is GitLab Flow?

| Topic               | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | GitLab Flow is a modern branching strategy that merges feature-based development with issue tracking and CI/CD pipelines.                          |
| **Purpose**          | It aims to simplify development and deployment across multiple environments while ensuring code quality and traceability.                         |
| **Key Feature**      | Combines Git Feature Branching, Continuous Integration/Delivery, and Issue-Based Development.                                                      |
| **Compared to Others** | Unlike Git Flow (complex for modern CD) or GitHub Flow (minimalist), GitLab Flow balances stability and flexibility for real-world DevOps pipelines. |

## 2. Why GitLab Flow?

GitLab Flow simplifies complex DevOps pipelines by blending code review, CI/CD automation, and environment-based deployment strategies. Unlike Git Flow (which is suited for versioned releases) or GitHub Flow (which is optimized for continuous deployment), GitLab Flow adapts to teams that handle multiple environments like `dev`, `staging`, and `production`.

| Reason                        | Explanation                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CI/CD Integration             | Seamless integration with GitLab’s native CI/CD tools                                             |
| Environment Flexibility       | Supports dev, staging, and production environments                                                |
| Traceability                  | Strong linkage between issues, merge requests, and deployments                                    |
| Hybrid Development Support    | Works well for both trunk-based and feature-branch-based development                             |
