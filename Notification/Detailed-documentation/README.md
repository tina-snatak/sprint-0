## 1. Introduction

This document provides comprehensive information about the **Notification Microservice**, which is responsible for delivering system-generated notifications through different channels like **Email**, **SMS**, and **Push Notifications**. The documentation includes setup, environment configuration, running the service, and debugging support.

---

## 2. What is Notification Microservice?

Notification Microservice is a standalone service that manages the delivery of various types of notifications (email, SMS, push) to users in an asynchronous, event-driven manner. It stores and retrieves notification logs and templates using **Elasticsearch** for fast search and analytics.

---

## 3. Why Use Notification Microservice?

* Decouples notification logic from core applications  
* Enables asynchronous and searchable logging  
* Scalable and reusable across microservices  
* Centralizes notification management  
* Easy to integrate via REST APIs or messaging systems

#### Dataflow Diagram Explanation

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Frontend / Any Microservice | A client or microservice triggers the process by sending a REST API request. |
| 2. REST API Request | The request is received and passed to the Notification Service for processing. |
| 3. Notification Service | Handles event logic, logs data to Elasticsearch, and prepares the notification. |
| 4. Elasticsearch & Delivery APIs | Elasticsearch stores logs/search data, and Email/SMS/Push APIs deliver the notification to the end user. |

## 5. Setup & Installation

For detailed installation steps, prerequisites, and deployment guidelines, refer to the **[Notification Microservice POC Documentation](https://github.com/Snaatak-Apt-Get-Swag/documentation/blob/scrum-66-sunny/OT-Microservices/Application/Notification/POC/README.md)**.

## 7. Features

| Feature            | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Elasticsearch Logs | Stores and searches notification delivery logs |
| Email Notification | Sends templated emails via SMTP                |
| SMS Notification   | Sends messages using SMS APIs (e.g., Twilio)   |
| Push Notification  | Firebase integration for mobile alerts         |
| Template Support   | Dynamic content based on message templates     |

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Problem                | Solution                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Email not sent         | Verify SMTP credentials and port         |
| Logs not stored        | Check Elasticsearch connection and index |
| SMS gateway fails      | Check API key and balance                |
| Firebase not sending   | Validate your Firebase key and project   |

## 9. Advantages

| Advantage                         | Description                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Centralized Notification Handling | Easier to manage and update templates or logic   |
| Searchable Logs                   | Use Elasticsearch to trace and analyze delivery  |

| Delay in High Load              | Under heavy event load, processing might be delayed                        |
| Security Risks                  | SMTP credentials and data must be securely stored to avoid misuse          |
| Maintenance Effort              | Regular updates and monitoring needed for dependencies and worker scripts  |

| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use versioned templates and fallback logic         | Maintain multiple versions of templates and a fallback in case of failure  |
| Secure secrets using vaults or env variables       | Store SMTP credentials and API keys securely to prevent unauthorized access |
| Index logs in Elasticsearch with timestamps & metadata | Add timestamps and metadata to make logs easier to search and analyze      |
| Enable retry and alerting for failed notifications | Automatically retry failed deliveries and alert administrators             |
