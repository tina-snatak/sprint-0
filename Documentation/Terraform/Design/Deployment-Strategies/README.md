## 1. Introduction
Deployment strategies define the approach and methodology used to release software updates, features, or fixes to a production environment. They help ensure minimal downtime, reduce risk, and maintain application reliability during deployments.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of deployment strategies, their importance, types, and key considerations to guide planning and execution.

---

## 3. What is a Deployment Strategy?
A **deployment strategy** is a structured plan that defines how software updates are delivered to production environments. It outlines the sequence of steps, rollback mechanisms, testing procedures, and monitoring required to deploy software safely.

## 6. A Generic Deployment Strategy
A **generic deployment strategy** typically involves these steps:  

1. **Plan & Prepare**: Define goals, schedule, and rollback plan.  
2. **Build & Test**: Compile code, run automated tests, and validate artifacts.  
3. **Deploy to Staging**: Test the deployment in a staging environment that mirrors production.  
4. **Production Deployment**: Deploy incrementally, monitor health, and verify stability.  
5. **Rollback & Mitigate**: In case of issues, roll back changes and investigate failures.

|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recreate**        | Stops old version, deploys new one; downtime expected                        |
| **Rolling**         | Incrementally replaces instances with new version                             |
| **Blue-Green**      | Maintains two environments; switches traffic to new environment seamlessly    |
| **Canary**          | Releases new version to a small user subset before full rollout               |
