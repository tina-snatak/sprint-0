## 1. Introduction
When developers build Java applications, they use third-party libraries (also called dependencies) to save time. But sometimes, these libraries have bugs or security issues. **Dependency scanning** helps to **find and fix** such issues early, so that your application remains **secure and reliable**.

---

## 2. What is Dependency Scanning?
Dependency scanning is the process of automatically checking the libraries (dependencies) used in your project for Known security vulnerabilities, Outdated versions, License issues



---

## 3. Why is Dependency Scanning Important?

| **Reason**                | **Why It’s Important** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Avoid security breaches** | Protect your application from known bugs in libraries. |
| **Save time and cost**      | Fixing issues early is cheaper and easier. |
| **Stay compliant**          | Meet license and policy requirements. |
| **Build trust**             | Users trust secure and well-maintained software. |

## Explaination

| Step No. | Step Name       | Description                                                                 |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Start            | The CI process begins for your Java application.                            |
| 2        | Check Code       | Java code is reviewed for syntax errors and logical issues.                 |
| 3        | Compile          | Java source files (`.java`) are compiled into bytecode (`.class`).         |
| 4        | Test             | Unit and integration tests (e.g., JUnit, TestNG) are executed.              |
| 5        | Pass Linting     | Code style and formatting are validated using tools like Checkstyle/PMD.   |
| 6        | Deploy           | The compiled application is deployed to a test or staging environment.      |
| 7        | Any Bugs?        | Bugs are checked post-deployment:                                           |
|          |                  | **No Bugs** → App is **Released** and the CI workflow **Ends**.          |
|          |                  | **Yes** → Bugs are **Fixed**, and the process restarts from **Check Code**. |

## 7. Advantages of Using Dependency Scanning

| Advantage              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Better Security**    | By automatically scanning all the dependencies used in your project, these tools help detect known vulnerabilities (CVEs) early in the development lifecycle. This allows teams to fix issues before they reach production, significantly reducing the attack surface. |
| **Faster Development** | Dependency scanning helps developers catch issues early, reducing the time spent later in the development lifecycle on debugging and patching. |
| **Easier Maintenance** | Keeping track of dependency versions and their vulnerabilities manually is difficult. Scanning tools automate this process and often provide upgrade suggestions or auto-fix pull requests. |
| **Team Collaboration** | Many dependency scanning tools integrate with Git platforms and CI/CD tools, enabling all team members to be aware of dependency risks and stay in sync on fixes. |

---

## 8. Best Practices

| Best Practice                  | Why It Matters |
|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Run scans **regularly** (in CI pipelines) | Ensures vulnerabilities are caught early and consistently. |
| Avoid **unknown or outdated libraries**   | Reduces security risks from untrusted or unsupported code. |
| Enable **notifications**                  | Keeps the team informed of new vulnerabilities in real-time. |
| Maintain an **approved dependencies list**| Ensures only safe and validated dependencies are used. |

|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Snyk**                    | Best choice for most developers and teams due to ease of use, rich features, and a generous free tier. |
| **OWASP Dependency-Check**  | Solid alternative for offline or open-source-only projects. Recommended starting point for **Java projects**. |
