| **Step No.** | **Step Name**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Example**                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | **Start**        | The process is initiated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | A developer pushes new code to the GitHub repository.                                               |
| 2            | **Check Code**   | The code is reviewed for quality, errors, or basic issues.                                                                                                                                                                                         | A static analysis tool like SonarQube runs to identify code smells or vulnerabilities.              |
| 3            | **Compile**      | Source code is compiled into an executable or build artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Maven compiles a Java project and generates a `.jar` file.                                          |
| 4            | **Test**         | Automated tests are executed to verify the functionality and integrity of the code.                                                                                                                                                                | JUnit tests are triggered in the CI pipeline to validate business logic.                            |
| 5            | **Pass Linting** | Code style and formatting are validated using linting tools.                                                                                                                                                                                       | ESLint or Pylint checks that the code follows team style guidelines (e.g., no unused imports).      |
| 6            | **Deploy**       | The application is deployed to a testing or staging environment.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Jenkins deploys the app to a Kubernetes staging cluster using Helm charts.                          |
| 7            | **Any Bugs?**    | Based on testing and feedback, take one of the following actions: <br><br> • **No Bugs** → Application is **Released**, and the workflow **Ends**. <br> • **Yes** → Bugs are **Fixed**, and the process **restarts** from **Step 2 - Check Code**. | QA team finds a UI bug:<br>• Developer fixes it<br>• Pushes again<br>• Workflow resumes from Step 2 |
